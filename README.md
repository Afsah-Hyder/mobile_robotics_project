Welcome to the final project of our group for the course Mobile Robotics (EE/CEE 468), offered in Habib University during Fall 2024. Our group consists of Afsah Hyder, Ailiya Fatima, Ali Nisar, and Shaheer Abbas. This repository is a ROS2 workspace that represents the work our team (and more) have accomplished so far regarding making a tow truck autonomous. We built on this to specifically create a project for the course, where we would explore addition multiple trailers to a tricycle model, mapping in an industrial environment using SLAM, creating a model that would plug into Nav2 resources (such as EKF and AMCL), and analysis of the parameters of EKF and AMCL algorithms. The report describes the details of our process comprehensively, so this README will be focused on the code.

As typical in a ROS2 workspace, our main work lies in the src subfolder -- the remaining subfolders were automatically generated by colcon build. Within src, we have two major packages: gazebo_ros_ackermann_drive_debug, which utilizes a Gazebo plugin to simulate a robot with Ackermann steering, send control commands, publish odometry data, and so on. The other package contains the main work that we accomplished during our project and beyond. 

For example, there is a scripts subfolder within the package that contains the files we used to record the real data, the estimated data, and plot the errors among the two. One is for EKF, and the other is for AMCL; they are practically the same, just that they subscribe to different topics for estimated data. The models subfolder contains -- among other items -- a couple of URDF files. We are using the second version to define our robot. There is also the basic_mobile_bot_description in this same subfolder that contains the meshes and the SDF files, of which we are using model.sdf to display the robot in Gazebo. If we go back to the package's directory, we'll also notice the worlds subfolder, which contains smalltown.world that we used for the AMCL & EKF simulations. The imc world will also be uploaded here later.

Besides that, we have the YAML file for the EKF algorithm inside the config subfolder. This is what we edited to observe how the EKF's performance changes with different parameter values. The map we used for AMCL is in the maps subfolder, stored as a YAML and a PGM file. There also exists my_map, which was used elsewhere previously. Within the params subfolder is nav2_params.yaml, which we edited to observe how AMCL changes with modified parameter values. Finally, the launch file which runs Gazebo, RViz, and everything else needed to keep the system running is located in the launch subfolder -- in particular, we used the v5 Python file. 

This information should be sufficient for now to give a brief overview of our work. For more information regarding system architecture, details, results, and so on, please refer to the project report. This may also be updated very soon to include details of other work on the project, especially regarding the trailers.
